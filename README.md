# Pizza Ordering System (Java Design Patterns) 🍕

A specialized Java application developed to demonstrate the implementation of the **Builder Design Pattern**. This project showcases how to manage complex object creation through a clean, maintainable, and scalable architectural approach.

### 🛠 Technical Highlights

* **Design Pattern:** Implemented the *Builder Pattern* to handle diverse pizza configurations and optional ingredients without constructor bloating.
* **Clean Code:** Focused on readability and separation of concerns within the object instantiation process.
* **Logic Flow:** Manages the step-by-step assembly of orders, ensuring data integrity across the system.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Custom Order Engine:** Allows for the dynamic creation of pizza objects with varied attributes.
* **Validation:** Ensures that all required components of an order are present before finalization.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to easily add new ingredients or pizza styles without breaking existing logic.

### 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Patterns:** Builder Pattern
